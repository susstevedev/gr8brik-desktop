# gr8brik-dekstop
Gr8brik native Windows desktop program.

# How to install?
Go to the "Releases" tab and you should see the newest version. Note that Gr8brik desktop and Gr8brik do not sync the versions. I manually update both.

# System requirements
- Operating system: Microsoft Windows 7 or Linux equivalent via Wine, Windows 11 is recommended (MacOS not supported at the moment).
- Processer: Intel Pentium 3 or AMD K6-III. Other brands may not work.
- Memory: 1024 Megabytes (1GB).
- Graphics card: GeForce FX (NV3x), AMD Radeon 9500. Integrated includes the Intel GMA 3100 and AMD Radeon HD 5000.

# How to build it yourself
- Download Chromium Portable from https://crportable.sourceforge.net
- Download the Gr8brik files (click on "code" > "download zip")
- Install Chromium Portable to somewhere and extract the code to the Chromeium Portable is. Make sure that Gr8brik's files are directly in Chromium's folder, not in ANY sub folders.
- There you go, it's installed without the installer. Most code is open source (the .ISS in the releases too)
